Roads:
•	Path
o	The path parameter accepts a list of latitude/longitude pairs
•	Key
o	must identify itself every time it sends a request to the Roads
•	interpolate
o	to interpolate a path to include all points forming the full road-geometry
•	snappedPoints
o	An array of snapped points. Each point consists of the following fields
	Location
•	Contains a latitude and longitude
	originalIndex
•	An integer that indicates the corresponding value in the original request
	interpolate=true
•	the response will contain more coordinates than the request.
	originalIndex
•	These values are indexed from 0, so a point with an originalIndex of 4 will be the snapped value of the 5th latitude/longitude passed to the path parameter
	placeId
•	A unique identifier for a place
•	speedLimits
o	An array of road metadata
•	Units
o	KPH or MPH
•	nearestRoads
o	indicates roads near to present location
Destination

•	Origin
o	origin=41.43206,-81.38992
o	place_id
	origin=place_id:ChIJ3S-JXmauEmsRUcIaWtf4MzE
•	destination
•	mode 
o	 Specifies the mode of transport to use when calculating directions.
o	Driving
o	Walking
o	Transit - directions via public transit routes
o	arrival_time
•	waypoints
o	Specifies an array of waypoints for routing
•	alternatives – 
o	specifies that the Directions service may provide more than one route 
•	avoid
o	highways
o	indoor
o	ports
•	language
o	The language in which to return results
•	Units
o	Specifies the unit system to use when displaying results
•	Region
o	 Specifies the region code
•	departure_time
o	Specifies the desired time of departure
•	arrival_time
o	Specifies the desired time of arrival
•	traffic_model
o	Specifies the assumptions to use when calculating time in traffic
•	duration_in_traffic
o	best_guess
	should be the best estimate of travel time given what is known about historical traffic conditions
o	pessimistic
	 should be longer than the actual travel time
o	Optimistic
	 should be shorter than the actual travel time
•	transit_mode
o	Specifies one or more preferred modes of transit
•	transit_routing_preference
o	Specifies preferences for transit routes

Error capturing
•	Code
o	HTTP status of the response.
•	Message
o	short description of the error
•	status
o	status code indicating the nature of the error
